<p>My name is Alexander Dicks, and I am a 15-year-old sophomore residing in the small, peaceful suburbs of Willingboro. I have always been passionate about technology and have dedicated myself to building a strong foundation in this field. Throughout the years, I have conducted extensive research and utilized my knowledge to assist others with their technological inquiries and problems, as well as create my own personal projects.
<br>
I am currently a student at Burlington County Institute of Technology (BCIT) Westhampton, where I have the opportunity to continue expanding my knowledge and skills. I thrive in diverse environments and am always excited to take on new challenges that allow me to grow both personally and professionally. My ultimate aspiration is to establish my own tech startup company, where I can innovate and create solutions for real-world problems using technology.</p>

In my free time, I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music, immersing myself in the world of video games, staying informed about current events, going for bike rides, taking care of my little brother, and engaging in regular running sessions to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle.</p>

<h1>Prelude To High School</h1>
<p>Before high school, I attended Memorial Middle School in Willingboro, New Jersey. While at Memorial, I made the honor roll twice in 8th grade. As I approached my last year at the school, I started thinking about high school. I knew I wanted to attend a career-focused school and meet new people. After applying and taking the entrance exam, I was accepted shortly after.</p>
<br>
<h1>A Day In My Life</h1>
<p>I wake up at 6:30 a.m. and prepare for school. I arrive at school around 8:00 a.m. and at 8:12 a.m. I go to my "shop". "Shops" or CTE (Career and Technical Education) classes are courses offered at the BCIT campuses and other technical schools. These classes cover a wide range of subjects from architecture to veterinary to information technology, to provide real-world job experience. Some classes even offer resources that can certify a student's work experience, such as in the field of IT.</p>
